Create a repo:

Go to the folder where you store all your repos. 
$ git init myrepo   -> This will create a folder named 'myrepo'
You can also be in a folder with contens and type $ git init
A hidden folder '.git' is created. When removint it, the folder is no longer a repo.
So nothing is really stored elsewhere other than the folder where the contents are.

Configuration of the git - NEEDED  for info on who is working on what
$ git config --global user.name "name here"
$ git config --global user.email "email here"

Saving changes
$ git status  -> tells you what's up. Chances are something is not tracked.
$ git add -A  -> adds all the files to tracking
$ git commit -m "message"  -> finalize the changes, comment with the message

Retrieving previous versions
$ git log --oneline    -> this gives a list of statuses, with a code
$ git revert [code]

Cloning
Go to the parent folder where you want the repo to be created
$ git clone [URL]

Pushing
The repo must exists beforehand
Create a personal access token: Github profile (top right),
'developer settings' from left menu, 'Personal access tokens', Generate new token,
give it a name, grant access, finally go below and push generate token.
$ git remote add origin [URL]  -> This adds the URL to the repo config file
$ cat .git/config   -> we check here that the config points to the repo URL
$ git push origin master   -> you are asked for username     xxxxxx@github.com
