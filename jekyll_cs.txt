There's actually no need to install Jekyll!!!

Find a theme to fork, like the example below.
https://github.com/niklasbuschmann/contrast

Name the repo as username.github.io
In the <code> tab -> settings icon top right -> set the URL that looks like:
https://username.github.io
In the Settings->Pages menu entry, select the master brach, then save. 
It takes a couple minutes to get the site published.

clone the repo

Adding content:
In folder _posts maybe copy and adapt files
